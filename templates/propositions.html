<div class="text">
    <p>There are three <mark><strong>'Propositions'</strong></mark> for you the only three kinds we are going to use in this Game:
    and the first thing to be done is to learn how to express them on the Board. </p>

<br>

    <p>Let us begin with <em>"Some red Apples are ripe."</em></p>

<br>

    <p>But, before doing so, a remark has to be made one that is rather important, and by no means easy
    to understand all in a moment: so please to read this very carefully.</p>

    <p>The world contains many <mark><strong>Things</strong></mark> (such as "Buns", "Babies", "Beetles", "Battledores", &c.);
    and these
    Things possess many <mark><strong>Attributes</strong></mark> (such as "baked", "beautiful", "black", "broken",
    &c: in fact, what
    ever can be <em>"attributed to"</em>, that is <em>"said to belong to"</em>, any Thing, is an Attribute). Whenever we
    wish to mention a Thing, we use a <mark><strong>Substantive</strong></mark>: when we wish to mention an
    Attribute, we use an <mark><strong>Adjective</strong></mark>.
    People have asked the question "Can a Thing exist without any Attributes belonging to it ?"It is a
    very puzzling question, and I'm not going to try to answer it: let us turn up our noses, and treat it with
    contemptuous silence, as if it really wasn't worth noticing. But, if they put it the other way, and ask
    "Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to ?", we may say at once "No: no more than
    a Baby could go a railway-journey with no one to take care of it!" You never saw "beautiful" floating
    about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing to be beautiful, now did you ? </p>

    <p>And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole? It is this. You may put <mark>"is"</mark> or <mark>"are"</mark>
    between the names of two Things (<b>for example</b>, "some Pigs are fat Animals"), or between the names
    of two Attributes (<b>for example</b>, "pink is light-red"), and in each case it will make good sense.
    But, if you put <mark>"is"</mark> or <mark>"are"</mark> between the name of a Thing and the name of an Attribute
    (<b>for example</b>, "some Pigs are pink"), you do not make good sense (<em>for how can a Thing be an Attribute ?</em>)
    unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking. <strong>And the simplest understanding
    would, I think, be this</strong> <em>that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence,
    so that the sentence, if written out in full, would be "some Pigs are pink (Pigs)"</em>. And now the word "are"
    makes quite good sense.</p>

    <p>Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition "some red Apples are ripe", we must suppose it to
    be written out in full, in the form "some red Apples are ripe (Apples)". Now this contains <strong>two 'Terms'</strong>
    "red Apples" being one of them, and "ripe (Apples)" the other. " Red Apples," being the one we are
    talking about, is called the <mark><strong>'Subject'</strong></mark> of the Proposition, and "ripe (Apples)"
    the <mark><strong>'Predicate'</mark></strong>. Also
    this Proposition is said to be a <mark><strong>'Particular'</strong></mark> one, since it does not speak
    of the whole of its Subject,
    but only of a part of it. The other two kinds are said to be <mark><strong>'Universal'</strong></mark>
    because they speak of the
    whole of their Subjects the one denying ripeness, and the other asserting it, of the whole class of
    "red Apples". Lastly, <mark>if you would like to have a definition of the word 'Proposition' itself, you
    may take this: â€” "a sentence stating that some, or none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain
    class, called its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called
    its 'Predicate'."<mark></p>

    <p><i><b>Now please to look at the smaller Diagram on the Board, and suppose it to be a cupboard,
    intended for all the Apples in the world (it would have to be a good large one, of course).
    And let us suppose all the red ones to be put into the upper half ( marked x ), and all the
    rest (that is, the not-red ones) into the lower half ( marked x' ). Thus the lower half would
    contain yellow Apples, blue Apples, mauve-coloured Apples if there are any: I haven't seen many,
    myself and so on. Let us also suppose all the ripe Apples to be put into the left-hand half
    ( marked y ), and all the rest (that is, the unripe ones) into the right-hand half ( marked y' ).
    At present, then, we must understand x to mean "red", x' "not-red", y "ripe", and y' "unripe".</b></i></p>

    <br>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"><strong>And now what kind of Apples would you expect to find in compartment No. 5?</strong></p>

    <br>

    <p>It is part of the upper half, you see; so that, if it has any Apples in it, they must be red: and it is part
    of the left-hand half; so that they must be ripe. Hence, if there are any Apples in this compartment, they must
    have the double Attribute' "red and ripe": or, if we use letters, they must be <b>( x / y )</b>.</p>

    <p>Take No. 7, for instance. If there are any Apples there, they must be <b>( x' / y )</b>, that is, they must be
    "not-red and ripe".</p>

    <p>Now let us make another agreement that a <b style="color:green;">GREEN</b> compartment
    (the compartment pressed when <b style="color:green;">ONE OR MORE</b> is activated) in
    a compartment shall mean that it is 'occupied', that is, that there are some Apples in it.</p>

    <p>(The word <strong style="color:green;">'some'</strong> in Logic, means <strong style="color:green;">'ONE OR MORE'</strong>: so that
    a single Apple in a
    compartment would be quite enough reason for saying <b>"there are some Apples here"</b>). Also let us agree that a
    <b style="color:blue;">BLUE</b>
    compartment (the compartment pressed when <b style="color:blue;">EMPTY</b> is activated) shall mean that it is empty, that is, that
    there are no Apples in it.</p>

    <p>As the Subject of our Proposition is to be "red Apples", we are only concerned, at present, with the upper
    half of the cupboard, where all the Apples have the attribute <b>x</b>, that is, <b>"red."</b></p>

    <p>Now, fixing our attention on this upper half, suppose we found it marked like this,</p>

    <p>that is, with a <b style="color:green;">green counter</b> in <b>No. 5</b>. What would this tell us, with
    regard to the class of "red Apples"?</p>

    <p>Would it not tell us that there are some of them in the <b>x y</b>-compartment ? That is, that some of them
    <i>(besides having the Attribute x, which belongs to both compartments) have the Attribute y (that is, "ripe").</i>
    This we might express by saying " some x-Apples are y-(Apples)", or, putting words instead of letters, </p>

    <br>

    <p class="examples"><b>"Some red Apples are ripe (Apples)", <br>
        or, in a shorter form,  <br>
            "Some red Apples are ripe".</b></p>

    <br>

    <p><i>At last we have found out how to represent the first Proposition of this Section. If you have not
    clearly understood all I have said, go no further, but read it over and over again, till you do understand
    it. After that is once mastered, you will find all the rest quite easy.</i></p>

    <p>It will save a little trouble, in doing the other Propositions, if we agree to leave out the word
    "Apples" altogether. I find it convenient to call the whole class of Things, for which the cupboard is
    intended, the <strong>'Universe'</strong> Thus we might have begun this business by
    saying "Let us take a Universe of Apples." (Sounds nice, doesn't it?)</p>

    <p>Of course any other Things would have done just as well as Apples. We might make Propositions about
    <strong>"a Universe of Lizards "</strong>, or even "a Universe of Hornets". (Wouldn't that be a charming
    Universe to live in?) </p>

    <p>So far, then, we have learned that</p>

    <p>This means "no x are y, and none are y' ", that is, no
        red are ripe, and none are unripe" : which leads to the
        rather curious result that <b>"no red exist at all"</b> This
        follows from the fact that "ripe" and "not ripe"
        make what we call an <b style="color:red;"><i>"exhaustive"</i> division</b> of the class
        "red Apples": i . e., between them, they exhaust the
        whole class, so that all the red Apples, that exist, must
        be found in one or the other of them.</p>

        <p>And now suppose I were to ask you to represent,
            with counters, the contradictory to "no red exist at
            all" , that is, "some red exist", or, putting letters
            for words, "some x exist", how would you do it?</p>

        <p>This will puzzle you a little, I expect. Evidently
            you must put a counter <b><i>somewhere</i></b> in the <b>x-half</b>
            of the cupboard, since you know there are some red
            Apples.
            You must not put it into the left-hand
            compartment, for example, since you do not know the Apples to be ripe:
            nor may you put into the right-hand one, since you
            do not know them to be unripe.</p>

            <p>What, then, are you to do? I think the best way
                out of the difficulty is to place <b style="color:red;"><i>a yellow counter in two places of
            the board,</i></b>  the
            <b>xy</b>-compartment and the
                <b>xy'</b>-compartment (<b style="color:yellow;">Yellow</b> will never come alone on the board).

    <p>Our ingenious American cousins have invented a

    He likes the look of <b>No. 5</b>, and he likes the
    look of <b>No. 6</b>, and he doesn't know which to jump
    down into. So there he sits astride, silly fellow,
    dangling his legs, one on each side of the fence !</p>

    <p>Now I am going to give you a much harder one to
        make out. What does this mean ?</p>

    <p>This is clearly a double Proposition. It tells us,
    not only that "some x are y,"but also that "no x
    are not y." Hence the result is " all x are y," i . e.
    "all red are ripe", which is the last of the three
    Propositions at the head of this Section.</p>

    <p>We see, then, that the Universal Proposition
    "All red Apples are ripe "
    consists of two Propositions taken together, namely,
    "Some red Apples are ripe,"
    and "No red Apples are unripe."</p>

    <p>would mean " all x are y' ", that is,
    "All red Apples are unripe."</p>

    <p>Now what would you make of such a Proposition
    as "The Apple you have given me is ripe" ? Is it
    Particular, or Universal ?</p>

    <p>"Particular, of course," you readily reply. "One
    single Apple is hardly worth calling 'some,' even."</p>

    <p>No, my dear impulsive Reader, it is <b style="color:red;">'Universal'</b>.
    Remember that, few as they are (and I grant you they
    couldn't well be fewer), they are (or rather 'it is')
    all that you have given me! Thus, if (leaving 'red'
    out of the question) I divide my Universe of Apples
    into two classes: the Apples you have given me (to
    which I assign the upper half of the cupboard), and
    those you haven't given me (which are to go below)
    I find the lower half fairly full, and the upper one
    as nearly as possible empty. And then, when I am
    told to put an upright division into each half, keeping
    the ripe Apples to the left, and the unripe ones to
    the right, I begin by carefully collecting all the Apples
    you have given me (saying to myself, from time to
    time, "Generous creature! How shall I ever repay
    such kindness?"), and piling them up in the left-hand
    compartment. <i>And it doesn't take long to do it!</i></p>

    <p>Here is another Universal Proposition for you. "Barzillai
    Beckalegg is an honest man." That means "All
    the Barzillai Beckaleggs, that I am now considering,
    are honest men." (You think I invented that name,
    now don't you? But I didn't. It's on a carrier's
    cart, somewhere down in Cornwall.)</p>

    <p>This kind of Universal Proposition (where the Subject
    is one single thing) is sometimes called an <b style="color:red;">"Individual"</b>
    Proposition.</p>

    <p>Now let us take "ripe Apples" as the Subject of
    our Proposition: that is, let us fix our thoughts on
    the left-hand half of the cupboard, where all the
    Apples have the attribute y, that is, "ripe".</p>

    <p>Suppose we find it marked like this:</p>

    <p>What would that tell us ?</p>

    <p>I hope that it is not necessary, after explaining the
    <i>horizontal</i> oblong so fully, to spend much time over
    the <i>upright</i> one. I hope you will see, for yourself,
    that this means "some y are x", that is,</p>

    <p class="examples"><b>"Some ripe Apples are red."</b></p>

    <p>But,"you will say, "we have had this case before.
    You put a <b style="color:green;">green counter</b> into <b>No. 5</b>, and you told us it meant
    'some red Apples are ripe'; and <i>now</i> you tell us that it
    means 'some <i>ripe</i> Apples are <i>red</i>'! Can it mean both ?"</p>

    <p>The question is a very thoughtful one, and does you
    <i>great</i> credit, dear Reader! It <i>does</i> mean both. If you
    choose to take <b>x</b> (that is, "red Apples") as your Subject,
    and to regard <b>No. 5</b> as part of a <i>horizontal</i> oblong, you
    may read it "some x are y", that is, "some red Apples
    are ripe" : but, if you choose to take <b>y</b> (that is, "ripe
    Apples") as your Subject, and to regard <b>No. 5</b> as part of
    an <i>upright</i> oblong, then you may read it "some y are x",
    that is, "some ripe Apples are red". They are merely
    two different ways of expressing the very same truth.</p>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"><b>And now I think we have said all we need to say
    about the <i>smaller Diagram</i>, and may go on to <i>the
    larger one.</i></b></p>

    <p>This may be taken to be a cupboard divided in the
    same way as the last, but also divided into two portions,
    for the Attribute <b><i>m</i></b>. Let us give to <b><i>m</i></b> the meaning
    "wholesome": and let us suppose that all <i>wholesome</i>
    Apples are placed <b><i>inside</i></b> the central Square, and all
    the <i>unwholesome</i> ones <b><i>outside</i></b> it, that is, in one or other
    of the four queer-shaped <b><i>outer</i></b> compartments.</p>

    <p>We see that, just as, in the smaller Diagram, the
    Apples in each compartment had <i>two</i> Attributes, so,
    here, the Apples in each compartment have <i>three</i> Attributes: and, just as the letters, representing the two
    Attributes, appear on the compartment when you place the mouse or click with your finger (if using a mobile device),
    so, here, they appear at the <i>corners</i>. (Observe
    that <b><i>m'</i></b> is supposed to be written at each of the four
    outer corners.) So that we can tell in a moment, by
    looking at a compartment, what three Attributes belong
    to the Things in it. For instance, take <b>No. 12</b>. Here we find <b><i>x, y', m,</i></b> at the corners: so we know
    that the Apples in it , if there are any, have the triple
    Attribute <b><i>x y' m</i></b>, that is, "red, unripe, and wholesome."
    Again, take <b>No. 16</b>. Here we find, at the corners,
    <b><i>x' y' m'</i></b>: so the Apples in it are "not-red, unripe,
    and unwholesome." (Remarkably untempting Apples !)</p>

    <p><i>It would take far too long to go through all the
    Propositions, containing <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, <b>x</b> and <b>m</b>, and <b>y</b> and <b>m</b>,
    which can be represented on this diagram (there are
    ninety-six altogether, so I am sure you will excuse
    me!), and I must content myself with doing two or
    three, as specimens. You will do well to work out
    a lot more for yourself.</i></p>

    <p>Taking the upper half by itself, so that our Subject
    is "red Apples", how are we to represent "no red
    Apples are wholesome" ?</p>

    <p>This is, writing letters for words, "no x are m." NOW
    this tells us that none of the Apples, belonging to the upper
    half of the cupboard, are to be found inside the central
    Square: that is, the two compartments, <b>No. 11</b> and <b>No. 12</b>,
    are empty. And this, of course, is represented by</p>

    <p>This tells us, as to the <b>x y</b>-Square, that one of its
    compartments is 'empty'. But this information is
    quite useless, as there is no mark in the other compartment.
    If the other compartment happened to be
    'empty' too, the Square would be 'empty': and, if it
    happened to be 'occupied', the Square would be
    'occupied'. So, as we do not know which is the case,
    we can say nothing about this Square.</p>

    <p>The other Square, the <b>x y'</b>-Square, we know (as in
